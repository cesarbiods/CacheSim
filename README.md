# CacheSim

This is a small program that simulates the behavior of a computer cache. It asks the user for the specifications of the cache, after which it is generated and proceeds to ask for memory addresses until the user types -1. The program checks to see if the current address is stored in memory and returns H for hit and M for miss.
